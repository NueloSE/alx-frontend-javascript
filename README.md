# Frontend Specialization Tasks

Welcome to the **Frontend Specialization** task repository! This repository contains various tasks and exercises that focus on frontend development skills. Each task is designed to help build proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, modern frontend frameworks, and tools commonly used in frontend web development.

## Project Overview

This repository is part of my journey to specialize in frontend development. Each folder contains a task or set of tasks covering different frontend topics like ES6 basics, DOM manipulation, React, TypeScript, and more.

The main objectives of these tasks are:

- **Mastering core web technologies** like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Learning modern frameworks and libraries** such as React, TypeScript, and Babel.
- **Understanding build tools** like Webpack, ESLint, and Jest for testing.

## Technologies Used

Here is a list of some of the main technologies, frameworks, and tools used in this repository:

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (with SASS/SCSS for some tasks)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **React** (for advanced frontend development)
- **TypeScript** (for type-safe JavaScript development)
- **Jest** (for unit testing)
- **ESLint** (for code linting)
- **Babel** (for compiling modern JavaScript)
- **Webpack** (for bundling assets and modules)

## Task Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

frontend-specialization/ │ ├── 0x00-ES6_basic/ # ES6 Basics ├── 0x01-DOM_manipulation/ # DOM Manipulation and Events ├── 0x02-React_intro/ # Introduction to React ├── 0x03-TypeScript_basics/ # TypeScript Fundamentals ├── 0x04-Webpack_setup/ # Webpack Configuration and Usage │ └── README.md # This file

### Task Breakdown

Each folder in the repository contains specific tasks. Here are some examples:

- **0x00-ES6_basic**: Tasks on ES6 features such as `let`, `const`, arrow functions, promises, and modules.
- **0x01-DOM_manipulation**: Practical exercises to manipulate the DOM and handle user events.
- **0x02-React_intro**: A basic introduction to React, including components, props, and state management.
- **0x03-TypeScript_basics**: Learning TypeScript by exploring type annotations, interfaces, classes, and generics.

## Installation & Setup

To set up and run the tasks locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nuelose/frontend-specialization.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

```bash

cd frontend-specialization
```

3. **Install dependencies**:

If a task requires specific dependencies (e.g., for React or TypeScript), navigate to the corresponding folder and run:

```bash

npm install
```

4. **Install ESLint, Jest, and Babel (if needed)**:

```bash
npm install eslint jest babel
```

## How to Run Tasks

Each task may have its own set of instructions. Here are general instructions for running tasks:

1. **Run a specific task file (e.g., 0-main.js in the ES6 tasks):**

```bash
npm run dev <file-name>
```

2. **Run unit tests (for tasks using Jest):**

```bash
npm run test
```

3. **Lint your code (for tasks using ESLint):**

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Example Commands

- To run an ES6 script:

```bash
npm run dev 0x00-ES6_basic/0-main.js
```

- To run React tasks:

```bash

cd 0x02-React_intro
npm start
```
